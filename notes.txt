1. For CTEs, it can be helpful to just create the different parts of the CTE as their own sql file in the folder for the data source
2. window functions don't auto-alias a column to the name of the window funciton

example: dense_rank() OVER (partition by my_column order by my_other_column) 
was aliased to dense_rank() OVER (partition by my_column order by my_other_column) rather than dense_rank.

Which may be weird to catch.
