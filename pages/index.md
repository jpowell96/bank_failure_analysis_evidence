## Overview

This is an Evidence Project that does a small analysis of the [FDIC Bank Failures Dataset](https://www.fdic.gov/resources/resolutions/bank-failures/in-brief/index). Its goal is to try some time series data analysis with SQL and to try out [Evidence](https://docs.evidence.dev/), a project that allows you to generate static reports from your datasources.

Take a look at the Writeup section for a complete breakdown of the data.
